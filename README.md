isingLenzMC: Monte Carlo for Classical Ising Model

[Stable release on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/isingLenzMC/index.html)

# Description
Classical Ising Model is a land mark system in statistical physics. The model explains 
the physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, and cooperative phenomenon 
in general, for example phase transitions and neural networks. This package provides 
utilities to simulate one dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and Glauber Monte 
Carlo with single flip dynamics in periodic boundary conditions. Utility functions 
for exact solutions are provided.
